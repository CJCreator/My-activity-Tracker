üöÄ How to Use
This is a standalone HTML file. No installation, internet connection (after initial download), or complex setup is required.

Download the File:

Right-click on the index.html file (or the link to it if shared via cloud storage).
Select "Save link as..." or "Save page as..."
Save the file to a location on your computer (e.g., your Desktop or a dedicated "Apps" folder).
Open the Application:

Navigate to where you saved the index.html file.
Double-click the index.html file. It will open automatically in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

üîí Security & Data Privacy
Your data is stored locally in your browser's Local Storage. This means:

Private to Your Device: Your activities are only accessible on the computer and browser where you use the application. No data is sent to any external server.
No Central Server: This application does not connect to any online database or cloud service.
PIN/Password as a Deterrent: The implemented PIN/password system provides a barrier against casual access to your data on the same computer. However, as it's a client-side solution, it's not designed to withstand sophisticated hacking attempts. Do not use highly sensitive passwords or confidential information if you have concerns about advanced security.
üõ†Ô∏è Development & Contribution

Structure: All code is self-contained within index.html.
Data Persistence: Utilizes localStorage for all data storage.
Hashing: Employs the browser's native Web Crypto API (SHA-256) for password hashing.
